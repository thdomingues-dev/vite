# vite-project
### Hey there, lets vite.

<br />

> Description :bookmark:

This project has an educational purpose, where I started using Vite (an alternative way to create React projects instead of using CRA) and then I take the opportunity to add the modern use of redux (but same core concepts) with new features such as RTK Query.

<br />

> Vite features :book:
- A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
- More informations: [vite doc](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#overview)

<br />

> Redux Toolkit features :book:

The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:
- Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
- I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
- Redux requires too much boilerplate code"
- More informations: [redux toolkit doc](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

<br />

> RTK Query features :book:

RTK Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool. It is designed to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.
RTK Query is an optional addon included in the Redux Toolkit package, and its functionality is built on top of the other APIs in Redux Toolkit.
- Tracking loading state in order to show UI spinners
- Avoiding duplicate requests for the same data
- Optimistic updates to make the UI feel faster
- Managing cache lifetimes as the user interacts with the UI
- More informations: [rtk query doc](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
